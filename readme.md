# Remove Background in Python

This code briefly handles removing the background from an image and saving the output image. Now, let's go over the different parts of the code.

## Installation

```bash
pip install rembg
```

## Contributing

Here's a brief explanation of the code in English:

1.Importing Libraries:
   - `from rembg import remove`: Imports the `rembg` library, which is used for removing the background from images.
   - `from PIL import Image`: Imports the `PIL` (Python Imaging Library) for image manipulation, though it's not directly used in this code.

2. Defining Input and Output Paths:
   - `input_path = "rayan.jpg"`: Specifies the input file path (the original image).
   - `output_path = "output.jpg"`: Specifies the output file path (the image with the background removed).

3. Opening Input and Output Files:
   - `with open(input_path, "rb") as i:`: Opens the input file in binary read mode.
   - `with open(output_path, "wb") as o:`: Opens the output file in binary write mode.

4. Reading, Processing, and Writing the Image:
   - `input = i.read()`: Reads the content of the input file in binary format and stores it in the `input` variable.
   - `output = remove(input)`: Applies the `remove` function from the `rembg` library to the input image, removing the background. The result is stored in the `output` variable.
   - `o.write(output)`: Writes the processed image (with the background removed) to the output file.

**This code reads an image named "rayan.jpg", removes its background, and saves the result as "output.jpg".
